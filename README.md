# Trailwalkers Project

Started to do the prompt for SPTs take home code challenge. Ended up building the API for trails referenced in the prompt instead.

- Used .NET minimal API framework for the first time. Boy is it simple.
- Used xpath for the first time.
- Will probably include the hikes API (actual prompt) in the future.
